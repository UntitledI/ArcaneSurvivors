## Overview:  
As the lead UI/UX designer and developer for Arcane Survivors, I spearheaded the design and implementation of the user interface (UI) for the game, as well as the player abilities and movement mechanics. Arcane Survivors is a third person RPG survival game set in a rural village suddenly attacked by a demon lord! Survive waves of enemies, upgrade abilities, and save the village! 

### Technologies Used:  

* Game Engine: Unity  
* Programming Language: C#  
* UI/UX Design: Unity UI Toolkit  
* Graphics Design: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator  

### Responsibilities:  

* UI/UX Design: I designed the user interface (UI) elements for Arcane Survivors, including menus, HUD (heads-up display), health bars, inventory system, and interactive buttons. Using Unity's UI Toolkit, I created visually appealing and intuitive UI components that enhanced the overall gameplay experience and provided players with essential information and controls.  

* Player Abilities: I implemented specific player abilities that players could use to navigate the game world and overcome obstacles. Me specific implemented ability was a piercing arrow ability, that damaged incoming enemies in a straight line. 

* Integration with Game Mechanics: I collaborated closely with other team members, including game designers and programmers, to integrate the UI design and player abilities seamlessly into the overall game experience. This involved iteratively testing and refining each aspect of the UI and gameplay to ensure consistency, balance, and player engagement.
